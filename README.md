[Artificial Intelligence: Dive Right In and Give it a Shot](https://www.codingame.com/blog/dive-into-artificial-intelligence-fun/)|Interview|Thibaud|"I would recommend submitting code often. That is one mistake that people tend to make, especially with multi-player contests in my opinion. I think the sooner you get your code submitted, the sooner you can find out how you’re doing and then try to improve your solution." (Mikkanu)
[Be Lazy and Keep it Simple](https://www.codingame.com/blog/lazy-keep-simple/)|Article|Bob|"So, what’s left for me? Heuristics, simple ideas, more or less crude approximations. They will not yield perfect results, they may even fail quite horribly at times, but the point is that they will work well enough for what I want to achieve."
[Fall Challenge 2020 Teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY6IfT_pZFk)|Video|CodinGame|
[How to Become Legendary in a Multiplayer Coding Contest](https://www.codingame.com/blog/how-to-become-legendary-in-multiplayer/)|Article|Thibaud|"I try to stay away from the keyboard for the first few days of the contest. This time is spent on getting a deep understanding of the rules, and designing the full algorithm used to approach the contest. It is also helpful to take the time and observe what basic strategies are used by the first successful AIs. Those are certainly the ones that I will need to counter." (PB4)
[Lazy Coders Strike Back](https://www.codingame.com/blog/lazy-coders-strike-back/)|Article|Bob|"As one of my teachers said to me 20 years ago or so, any fool can build something complex, but it takes genius to come up with something simple and beautiful. I don’t see myself as a genius, but now I think I understand what he meant."
[The Coding Adventures of a Salesperson](https://www.codingame.com/blog/salesperson-coding/)|Article|TBali|“I became a Legend” 40 days after I signed up. I felt proud, even though I knew there were still 60 bots out there better than mine. I have to admit I could not have gotten this far without the collected wisdom in the forum posts and the coding streams I saw. But still, what is more important, I enjoyed the whole process and learned quite a lot during these 40 days."
[The Thrilling Challenge of Building Artificial Intelligence Bots](https://www.codingame.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-challenge/)|Interview|Aude|"Just jump in and try it. There is nothing to lose, so there is nothing to fear. I would start with the most basic AI you can come up with. Even if it is just moving the bot around the game board, that is great. From there, just add a bit more and more based on the challenge" (Scarak)
[15 Tips to Make the Most of the CodinGame Platform](https://www.codingame.com/blog/tips-make-most-codingame-platform/)|Article|Thibaud|"It probably doesn’t sound that incredible for regular users, but I can tell you that when I discovered that feature, it blew my mind. You can also play your code in the IDE against your code in the arena (i.e., the last code you submitted)."

[How to get started on CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55547/how-to-get-started-on-codingame)|Guide|Thibaud|"CodinGame's model is to communicate with text, via these streams: your program is given inputs (the data needed to solve the problem) in the stdin and you need to print out the requested answer in the stdout. Hence, one of our taglines being: "Read stdin, Flush stdout"
[My First Bot Programming Contest: Where to Begin?](https://www.codingame.com/blog/first-programming-contest/)|Article|splanard|"If, at the end of a contest, you’ve managed to learn something, developed pride in your bot or simply had fun, then you’ll have won."
[Tutorial for bot programming on CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53785/tutorial-for-bot-programming-on-codingame)|Guide|Thibaud|"My advice is to continue iterating. Just continue implementing the simplest ideas you can find to improve your bot's decision making. Sometimes, it can help to consider the game as if it was a board game: "With this board state, what is the best action I can do?"
[Contest Tools and Workflow](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow)|Guide|eulerscheZahl|"Reproducing a bug against a random opponent can be annoying. Even when the behaviour is perfectly reproducable online, it can be hard to debug in the offline IDE, when a match history is needed. Some games like Ocean of Code deal with fog of war, so copying the referee input of a single turn isn't enough to reproduce the same situtation offline."

[CGEnhancer](https://github.com/Azkellas/cgenhancer)|Tool|Azkellas|"The goal of this script is to make the user's life easier, especially during multi/contests. It comes with a bunch of features (see below for an exhaustive or-so list). The script currently works on chrome, chromium and firefox. It might work on chromium-based browser, such as opera and safari, but was not tested."
[CGLocal](https://github.com/jmerle/cg-local-app)|Tool|Jasperr|"This application should be used together with cg-local-ext. The application watches the selected file and sends the source code to the browser extension when the file is changed. It also makes it easy to configure the CG Local's settings."
[Designing the Perfect AI in a Coding Contest](https://www.codingame.com/blog/design-ai-contest/)|Article|Icebox|"The key differences that separate the coders at the top of the ladder are their approaches, different scoring strategies or their completely different learning models."

[A Look Back at the Greatest Event on CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/blog/spring-challenge-2020/)|Article|Thibaud|“Thanks to CG for this fun challenge – and thanks for bringing me and my old friend together again – it felt like we were 18 again bouncing ideas off each other and discussing theories together.” 
[The Challenge of Designing a Game for a Whole Community](https://www.codingame.com/blog/the-challenge-of-designing-a-game-for-a-whole-community/)|Article|Magus|"The CodinGame architecture forces the amount of data transiting between the referee and the view to be the smallest possible. If there is too much data, not only do you impact the bandwidth of CodinGame, but the games load up very slowly. Not to mention the space used on their servers."
