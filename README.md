[Artificial Intelligence: Dive Right In and Give it a Shot](https://www.codingame.com/blog/dive-into-artificial-intelligence-fun/)|Interview|Thibaud|"I would recommend submitting code often. That is one mistake that people tend to make, especially with multi-player contests in my opinion. I think the sooner you get your code submitted, the sooner you can find out how you’re doing and then try to improve your solution." (Mikkanu)
[Be Lazy and Keep it Simple](https://www.codingame.com/blog/lazy-keep-simple/)|Article|Bob|"So, what’s left for me? Heuristics, simple ideas, more or less crude approximations. They will not yield perfect results, they may even fail quite horribly at times, but the point is that they will work well enough for what I want to achieve."

[How to Become Legendary in a Multiplayer Coding Contest](https://www.codingame.com/blog/how-to-become-legendary-in-multiplayer/)|Article|Thibaud|"I try to stay away from the keyboard for the first few days of the contest. This time is spent on getting a deep understanding of the rules, and designing the full algorithm used to approach the contest. It is also helpful to take the time and observe what basic strategies are used by the first successful AIs. Those are certainly the ones that I will need to counter." (PB4)
